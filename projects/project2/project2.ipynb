    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",

    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Slack/Canvas Chat, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Slack/Chat post and the staff will respond. Take advantage of the plentiful help hours provided by your teaching team.\n",

    "**Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n",

To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section, we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n",
